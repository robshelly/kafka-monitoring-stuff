# kafka-monitoring-stuff

This repo has a set of Make targets for the installation and configuration of Kafka in OSD (using Strimzi), and various components to monitor Kafka.

## Prerequisites

- A running OpenShift 4 cluster with kubeadmin access
- oc and kubectl binaries, logged in to the OpenShift 4 cluster
- jq installed
- (optional) The strimzi-operator is running in the cluster. Make targets exist to do this as well.
- (optional) A Kafka CR exists & has been reconciled into a running Kafka cluster. Make targets exist to do this as well.

## Terminology

- `in-cluster`, `on-cluster`, `cluster-wide` Refer to things in the same cluster as the Strimzi operator & all the Kafka CRs it's managing
- `global`, `central`, `centralised` Refer to things that are *not* in the same cluster as the Strimzi operator. Typically only 1 instance of these things.

## Installation Options

### 1) Install *everything*

**Caution:** You probably don't want to do this. Consider installing just the in-cluster components or just the global components in a single cluster.

The following things will be installed:

* global monitoring components for centralised metrics
* cluster-wide monitoring components, configured to send metrics centrally
* strimzi operator
* strimzi monitoring components to hook into cluster-wide monitoring components
* a kafka cluster

```sh
make all
```

<h3>2) Install *global* components *only*</h3>

The following things will be installed:

* global monitoring components for centralised metrics

```sh
make monitoring/global
```

### 3) Install *in-cluster* components *only*

The following things will be installed:

* cluster-wide monitoring components, configured to send metrics centrally
* strimzi operator
* strimzi monitoring components to hook into cluster-wide monitoring components
* a kafka cluster

```sh
make strimzi/operator
make monitoring/cluster
make kafka/cr
```

### 4) Install *in-cluster* strimzi & kafka components *only* (no monitoring)

The following things will be installed:

* strimzi operator
* a kafka cluster

```sh
make strimzi/operator
make kafka/cr
```

### 5) Install *in-cluster* monitoring components *only*

This option is useful if you already have a cluster with the strimzi operator running & a Kafka CR.

The following things will be installed:

* cluster-wide monitoring components, configured to send metrics centrally
* strimzi monitoring components to hook into cluster-wide monitoring components


```sh
make monitoring/cluster
```

To specify which namespace strimzi & kafka are in, run the cmd with the following vars:

```sh
STRIMZI_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=my-strimzi-ns KAFKA_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE=my-kafka-ns make monitoring/cluster
```

## Uninstallation

```sh
make clean
```

__NOTE__: uninstalling the cluster prometheus namespace can take a few minutes

## Where's what?

The following namespaces are created:

* *kafka-operator*: contains the Strimzi operator
* *kafka-cluster*: contains the Kafka cluster
* *managed-services-monitoring-global*: contains the global monitoring stack including Grafana, Thanos Receiver and Thanos Querier
* *managed-services-monitoring-prometheus*: contains the on cluster Prometheus that scrapes Kafka metrics
* *managed-services-monitoring-grafana*: contains the on cluster Grafana instance

## Notes

* The Grafana instances are protected by the OpenShift OAuth proxy. Sign in using an OpenShift account with permission to `get` `namespaces`.
* To sign in to Grafana itself (once passed the proxy), use the credentials from the `grafana-admin-credentials` secret in `managed-services-monitoring-grafana` namespace. This is only required if you want to modify dashboards (temporary as dashboards are persisted in GrafanaDashboard CRs & cannot be saved from the Grafana UI)
